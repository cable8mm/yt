            [title] => Sergey Brin talks about Google Glass at TED 2013
            [description] => UPDATE: To address comments about Sergey's poor delivery, I want to emphasize that this is NOT a "TED Talk", despite it being recorded during TED conference. It is pretty much a spontaneous appearance to show the latest technology and wasn't prepared or rehearsed. Google Glass is also not available for purchase yet so it is not strictly speaking a product promotion either. This video is posted mostly because it has details about Glass that were unknown or unconfirmed before.
